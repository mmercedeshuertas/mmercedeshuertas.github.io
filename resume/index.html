  I am an enthusiastic User Experience Research expert and I love to create engaging experiences and facilitate customer’s interaction with technology by understanding their needs and motivations.
  Following a mixed-method approach, I apply qualitative methods (interviews, focus groups, ethnography) and quantitative measurements (Google Analytics, surveys), together with my analytical skills and lively wit, to understand trends and identify design directions.
